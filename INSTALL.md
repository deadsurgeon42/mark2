# installation

## requirements

* UNIX-like operating system (Linux, Mac OS X, BSD)
* python 2.6/2.7 (+ dev package for psutil installation)
* psutil
* urwid 1.x
* twisted
* twisted-web
* twisted-words (for IRC support)
* feedparser (for RSS support)
* pyopenssl (for push notifications and IRC over SSL)

### debian/ubuntu

This should suffice:

    $ sudo apt-get install git libssl-dev python-dev python-pip
    $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
    
### arch

    # pacman -S --needed python2 python2-psutil python2-urwid python2-twisted python2-feedparser python2-pyopenssl

### centos

CentOS and some other distros ship an older version of python. First check you have python 2.6 or 2.7:

    $ python2.6 -V
    $ python2.7 -V

If at least one of them works, you should be able to do:

    $ sudo yum install python-devel
    $ sudo easy_install pip
    $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

Otherwise, you need to install python 2.7. A decent guide for centos is
[located here](http://toomuchdata.com/2012/06/25/how-to-install-python-2-7-3-on-centos-6-2/). Be sure to follow the
instructions for installing distribute also.

Next, install twisted from the package on [their website](http://twistedmatrix.com/). Don't use easy_install - you
won't get the binaries that ship with twisted.

easy_install for python 2.7 is probably in `/usr/local/bin/easy_install-2.7`. You should use it to install the remaining
mark2 dependencies:

    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/easy_install-2.7 psutil urwid feedparser

## installation

mark2 doesn't need to be installed to a particular directory, but if you have no reasonable ideas `/usr/mark2` will be
okay. First, download mark2:

    $ git clone https://github.com/gsand/mark2.git

If you don't have git (and you probably should!) you could:

    $ wget https://github.com/gsand/mark2/archive/master.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf master.tar.gz
    $ rm master.tar.gz
    $ mv mark2-master mark2

Next, symlink the `mark2` script into your executable path:

    $ sudo ln -s /usr/mark2/mark2 /usr/bin/mark2

If you run mark2 on a server where you expect multiple system users to start servers, you *need* to create a dedicated
user to run servers under.

    $ sudo adduser mcservers

To start a server, run `mark2 start` as `sudo -u mcservers mark2 start ...`

### tips

If your server has a strange name, you have a couple of options:

1. add it to `mark2.jar-path` in your mark2.properties
2. specify the full path to the jar in `mark2 start`

If your servers all reside in one directory, you may want to add a start
helper to your path:

    #!/bin/bash
    mark2 start /path/to/servers/$1

And run it like

    $ mcstart pvp

Likewise if `mark2 attach -n blah` becomes a little too much, you could always
`alias at='mark2 attach -n'`
